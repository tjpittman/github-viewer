# github-viewer
Little angular.js app to take a given github username and display repositories and other information. 

Its not pretty but just a little app built as I followed along in a angular.js course. 

The username entered by default is 'angular' which if no other username is selected will search and display the public github repositories for angular.
One the repositories have been loaded. You can click on the specific repository to view open issues and contributors to the repository.

Again, nothing fancy, just an simple app built while taking a course to learn more on how angular works.
